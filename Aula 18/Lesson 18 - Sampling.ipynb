        "Imagine you're managing a small tech company with 8 employees. At the end of the year, you piece together some data about your employees, with the intention of understanding better the state of your company. The data you collected is straightforward, and you can quickly make a few conclusions just by using a bit of arithmetics and logic.\n",

You still want to get insights from data, but now you have so much of it that analyzing it has become difficult and inconvenient. As you continue to scale your company, analyzing data slowly gears toward becoming an impossible task.\n",

        "More years have gone by, and **now you run an international company with over 50000** employees. You've recently made a company-wide change which resulted in making the work of your employees more demanding. **Now you want to determine whether the employees have been impacted negatively in any significant way**. If this is true, then the change may backfire in the long run, and it'd be a good decision to revert the process while it's still possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "You reach out to your data analyst and ask for her opinion. She says that she can do a survey to collect data, and answer your question. Surveying over 50000 employees would be time-consuming and expensive, so you're being told that 100 people or so will be enough to survey to get an answer to your question.\n",
        "\n",
        "One week later, the analysis shows that people generally report they are less satisfied with their work compared to the last year (when the change hadn't been yet implemented). Also, the inability to balance work and personal life is the main reported cause of dissatisfaction. Your analyst also tells you that the decrease in satisfaction is significant, meaning that it's very unlikely to simply have happened by chance. Something must have caused the decrease, and that something is probably the major change you've done recently.\n",
        "\n",
        "This sort of scenario is very common in practice. As a data analyst, you'll often need to use a small set of data to answer questions about a much larger set of data.\n",

As a consequence, we should expect a large sampling error (a large discrepancy between our sample's statistic (sample mean height) and the population's parameter (population mean height)).\n",
        "\n",
        "In statistical terms, we want our samples to be **representative** of their corresponding populations. If a sample is representative, then the sampling error is low. The more representative a sample is, the smaller the sampling error. The less representative a sample is, the greater the sampling error.\n",

        "To make our samples representative, we can try to give every individual in the population an equal chance to be selected in our samples. We want a very tall individual to have the same chance as being selected as an individual having a medium or short height. To give every individual an equal chance of being picked, we need to sample **randomly.**\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to perform random sampling is to generate random numbers and use them to select a few sample units from the population. In statistics, this sampling method is called **simple random sampling**, and it's often abbreviated as **SRS**.\n",

        "In our previous exercise, we used **Series.sample()** to sample. This method performs simple random sampling by generating an array of random numbers, and then using those numbers to select values from a **Series** at the indices corresponding to those random numbers. The method can be also extended for DataFrame [objects](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html?highlight=sample#pandas.DataFrame.sample), where random rows or columns can be sampled.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we use the **random_state** parameter, like we did in the previous exercise with **Series.sample(30, random_state = 1)**, we make the generation of random numbers predictable. This is because **Series.sample()** uses a [pseudorandom number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) under the hood. A pseudorandom number generator uses an initial value to generate a sequence of numbers that has properties similar to those of a sequence that is truly random. With **random_state** we specify that initial value used by the pseudorandom number generator.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we want to generate a sequence of five numbers using a pseudorandom generator, and begin from an initial value of 1, we'll get the same five numbers no matter how many times we run the code. If we ran **wnba['Games Played'].sample(5, random_state = 1)** we'd get the same sample every time we run the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pseudorandom number generators are of great use in scientific research where [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) work is necessary. In our case, pseudorandom number generators allow us to work with the same samples as you do in the exercises, which allows in turn for a meaningful answer checking.\n",

        "You might not have been very impressed by what we've just got with sampling proportionally. The variability of the sampling was quite large, and many sample means were unrepresentative, being far from the population mean. In fact, this sampling method doesn't seem to perform better than simple random sampling:\n",

        "\n",
        "The poor performance is caused by a bad choice of strata. We stratified the data by the number of games played, but this isn't a good approach. A player is considered as having played one game even if she only played for one or two minutes. But others play 30 or 40 minutes, and they're still considered as having played one game.\n",
        "\n",
        "It makes more sense to stratify the data by number of minutes played, rather than by number of games played. The minutes played are a much better indicator of how much a player scored in a season than the number of games played.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our data set contains the total amount of minutes a player had for the entire season. If we make strata based on minutes played, and then sample proportionally using stratified sampling, we get something visibly better than simple random sampling (especially in terms of variability):\n",

        "We increased the sample size to 12 so that we can do a better proportional sampling for the strata organized by minutes played.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few guidelines for choosing good strata:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Minimize the variability within each stratum.**\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, avoid having in the same stratum a player that has scored 10 points and a player that has scored 500. If the variability is high, it might be a sign that you either need a more granular stratification (need more strata), or you need to change the criterion of stratification (an example of criterion is minutes played).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Maximize the variability between strata.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Good strata are different from one another. If you have strata that are similar to one another with respect to what you want to measure, you might need a more granular stratification, or to change the stratification criterion. In the previous screen, stratifying the data by games played resulted in strata that weren't too different from each other with respect to the distribution of the total points. We managed to increase the variability between strata by changing the criterion of stratification to minutes played.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. The stratification criterion should be strongly correlated with the property you're trying to measure.**\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, the column describing minutes played (the criterion) should be strongly correlated with the number of total points (property we want to measure). We've covered briefly the concept of correlation in the pandas lessons, and we'll cover it again later in these statistics lessons, so don't worry if the concept of correlation doesn't make much sense to you now.\n",
        "\n",
        "We've left the code editor open for you to try to experiment with the different sampling methods we've learned so far. One thing you can try is to replicate the last graph above. You can then play with sample sizes, and try to get insights into how variability and sampling error change."

Instead of working with more than 10 million rows at each step of your analysis, you can save a lot of code running time by sampling several hundred rows, and perform your analysis on the sample. You can do a simple random sampling, but if you're interested in some categories beforehand, it might be a good idea to use stratified sampling.\n",
