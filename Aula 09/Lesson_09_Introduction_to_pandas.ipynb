Because we can easily work across multiple dimensions, our code is a lot easier to understand. By using vectorized operations instead of loops, our code will be faster with larger data.\n","\n","NumPy provides fundamental structures and tools that makes working with data easier, but there are several things that limit it usefulness as a single tool when working with data:\n","\n","- The lack of support for column names forces us to frame the questions we want to answer as multi-dimensional array operations.\n","- Support for only one data type per ndarray makes it more difficult to work with data that contains both numeric and string data.\n","- There are lots of low level methods, however there are many common analysis patterns that don't have pre-built methods.\n","\n","The **pandas** library provides solutions to all of these pain points and more. Pandas is not so much a replacement for NumPy as an extension of NumPy. The underlying code for pandas uses the NumPy library extensively, which means the concepts you've been learning will come in handy as you begin to learn more about pandas.\n","\n","In this mission, we'll learn:\n","\n","- about the two core pandas types: dataframes and series\n","- how to select data using row and column labels\n","- a variety of methods for exploring data with pandas\n","- how to assign data using various techniques in pandas\n","- how to use boolean indexing with pandas for selection and assignment\n","\n","We'll be working with data set from [Fortune](http://fortune.com/) magazine's [Global 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_Global_500) list 2017, which ranks the top 500 corporations worldwide by revenue. The dataset we'll be using was originally compiled [here](https://data.world/chasewillden/fortune-500-companies-2017), however we have modified the original data set into a more accessible format.\n","\n","<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1vWtPGbbxR7Mn2xHg_KMa3MOKSqs05uyE\">\n","\n","\n","The dataset is a CSV file called **f500.csv**.

More commonly referred to as **pandas.DataFrame()** objects, or just **dataframes**, the type is the primary pandas data structure.\n","\n","Dataframes are two dimensional pandas objects, the pandas equivalent of a Numpy 2D ndarray. Unlike NumPy, pandas does not use the same type for 1D and 2D arrays.\n","\n","We'll learn about the second pandas data structure, series, later in this mission, but first, let's look at the anatomy of a dataframe, using a selection of our Fortune 500 data:\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1lUAxPbqauhiMPdWCAM2oPOy0vsmvWtYy\">\n","\n","There are three key things we can observe immediately:\n","\n","- In Red: Just like a 2D ndarray, there are two axes, however each axis of a dataframe has a specific name. The first axis is called **index**, and the second axis is called **columns.**\n","- In Blue: Our axis values have string **labels**, not just numeric locations.\n","- In Green: Our dataframe contains columns with **multiple dtypes**: integer, float, and string.\n","\n","We can use the [DataFrame.dtypes](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dtypes.html#pandas.DataFrame.dtypes) attribute (similar to NumPy's **ndarray.dtype** attribute) to return information about the types of each column. Let's see what this would return for our selection of data above:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> f500_selection.dtypes\n","\n","    rank          int64\n","    revenues      int64\n","    profits     float64\n","    country      object\n","    dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","We can see three different data types (dtypes), which correspond to what we observed by looking at the data:\n","\n","- int64\n","- float64\n","- object\n","\n","\n","We have seen the **float64** dtype before in NumPy. Pandas uses NumPy dtypes for numeric columns, including **integer64**. There is also a type we haven't seen before, **object**, which is used for columns that have data that doesn't fit into any other dtypes. This is almost always used for columns containing string values. If you like, you can run **f500.dtypes** in the console to see the types of all the columns in the f500 dataframe.\n","\n","When we import data, pandas will attempt to guess the correct dtype for each column. Generally, pandas does a pretty good job with this, which means we don't need to worry about specifying dtypes every time we start to work with data. Later in this course, we'll look at how to change the dtype of a column.\n","\n","Next, let's learn a few handy methods we can use to get some high-level information about our dataframe:\n","\n","- If we wanted to view the first few rows of our dataframe, we can use the [DataFrame.head()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.head.html) method, which returns the first 5 rows of our dataframe. The **DataFrame.head()** method also accepts an optional integer parameter which specified the number of rows. We could use **f500.head(10)** to return the first 10 rows of our **f500 dataframe**-.\n","- Similar in function to **DataFrame.head()**, we can use the [DataFrame.tail()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.tail.html) method, to shows us the last rows of our dataframe.

We use this convention because you also see this throughout the official pandas documentation, so getting used to reading it is important.

This works for single columns and lists of columns but not for for column slices. This style of selecting columns is very commonly seen and we will use it throughout our Dataquest missions.\n","2. **Dot Accessor** – Instead of **df.loc[:\"col_1\"]** you can use **df.col_1**.

Pandas also has a large number of methods and functions that make working with data easier. Let's use a few of these to explore our Fortune 500 data.\n","\n","The first method we'll learn about is the [Series.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.describe.html#pandas.Series.describe) method, which returns some descriptive statistics on the data contained within a specific pandas series. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","```python\n","revs = f500[\"revenues\"]\n","print(revs.describe())\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","count       500.000000\n","mean      55416.358000\n","std       45725.478963\n","min       21609.000000\n","25%       29003.000000\n","50%       40236.000000\n","75%       63926.750000\n","max      485873.000000\n","Name: revenues, dtype: float64\n","```\n","\n","We've assigned the **revenues** column to a new series, **revs**, and then used the **describe()** method on that series. The method tells us how many non-null values are contained in the series, the mean and standard devation, along with the minimum, maximum and [quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) values.\n","\n","Rather than assigning the series to it's own variable, we can actually skip that step and use the method directly on the result of the column selection. This is called **method chaining** and is a way to combine multiple methods together in a single line. It's not unique to pandas, however it is something that you see a lot in pandas code. Let's see what the command looks like with method chaining, using the **assets** column.\n","\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500[\"assets\"].describe())\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","count    5.000000e+02\n","mean     2.436323e+05\n","std      4.851937e+05\n","min      3.717000e+03\n","25%      3.658850e+04\n","50%      7.326150e+04\n","75%      1.805640e+05\n","max      3.473238e+06\n","Name: assets, dtype: float64\n","```\n","\n","From here, you'll start to see method chaining used more in our missions. When writing code, you should always assess whether method chaining will make your code harder to read. It's always preferable to break out into more than one line if it will make your code easier to understand.\n","\n","You might have noticed that the values in the code segment above look a little bit different. Because the values for this column are too long to display neatly, pandas has displayed them in **E-notation**, a type of [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation). Here is an expansion of what the E-notation represents:\n","\n","| Original Notation | Expanded Formula | Result |\n","|-------------------|--------------------|----------|\n","| 5.000000E+02 | 5.000000 * 10 ** 2 | 500 |\n","| 2.436323E+05 | 2.436323 * 10 ** 5 | 243632.3 |\n","\n","\n","If we use **describe()** on a column that contains non-numeric values, we get some different statistics. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500[\"country\"].describe())\n","\n","count     500\n","unique     34\n","top       USA\n","freq      132\n","Name: country, dtype: object\n","```\n","\n","Here is what the output indicates:\n","\n","The first statistic, **count**, is the same as for numeric columns, showing us the number of non-null values. The other three statistics are new:\n","\n","- **unique** - The number of unique values in the series. In this case, it tells us that there are 34 different countries represented in the Fortune 500.\n","- **top** - The most common value in the series. The USA is the most common country that a company in the Fortune 500 is headquartered in.\n","- **freq** - The frequency of the most common value. The USA is the country that 132 companies from Fortune 500 are headquartered in.\n","\n","Because series' and dataframes are two distinct objects, they have their own unique methods. There are many times where both series and dataframe objects have a method of the same name that behaves in similar ways. DataFrame objects also have a [DataFrame.describe()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) method that returns these same statistics for every column. If you like, you can take a look at the documentation using the link in the previous sentence to familiarize yourself with some of the differences between the two methods.\n","\n","One difference is that you need to specify manually if you want to see the statistics for the non-numeric columns. By default, **DataFrame.describe()** will return statistics for only numeric columns. If we wanted to get just the object columns, we need to use the **include=['O']** parameter when using the dataframe version of describe:\n","\n","```python\n","print(f500.describe(include=['O']))\n","```\n","\n","```python\n","_            ceo    industry     sector  country  hq_location    website\n","count        500         500        500      500          500        500\n","unique       500          58         21       34          235        500\n","top     Xavie...   Banks:...  Financ...      USA  Beijing,...  http:/...\n","freq           1          51        118      132           56          1\n","```\n","\n","Another difference is that **Series.describe()** returns a series object, where **DataFrame.describe()** returns a dataframe object. \n","\n","Let's practice using both the series and dataframe describe methods:\n","\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","1. Use the appropriate **describe()** method to:\n","  - Return a series of descriptive statistics for the **profits** column, and assign the result to **profits_desc**.\n","  - Return a dataframe of descriptive statistics for the **revenues** and **employees** columns, in order, and assign the result to **revenue_and_employees_desc**.\n","  - Return a dataframe of descriptive statistics for every column in the **f500** dataframe, by checking the documentation for the correct value for the **include** parameter, and assign the result to **all_desc**.\n","\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"h43tBXdoKpnl","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":320},"outputId":"4e25a255-3d07-43c9-f30f-aa29decf0d8c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1537564465436,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":730,"user":{"displayName":"Leticia

Here are a few handy methods (with links to documentation) that you might use when working with data in pandas:\n","\n","- [Series.max()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.max.html) and [DataFrame.max()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.max.html)\n","- [Series.min()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.min.html) and [DataFrame.min()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.min.html)\n","- [Series.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.mean.html) and [DataFrame.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html)\n","- [Series.median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.median.html) and [DataFrame.median()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.median.html)\n","- [Series.mode()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.mode.html) and [DataFrame.mode()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mode.html)\n","- [Series.sum()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.sum.html) and [DataFrame.sum()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.sum.html)\n","\n","\n","As the documentation indicates, the series methods don't require an axis parameter, however the dataframe methods will so we know which axis to calculate across. While you can use integers to refer to the first and second axis, pandas dataframe methods also accept the strings **\"index\"** and **\"columns\"** for the axis parameter. Let's refresh our memory on how this works:\n","\n","<img width=\"700\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1euiSMOgXE7IVP_U-VIRzwV6JAXBpC4yx\">\n","\n","For instance, if we wanted to find the median (middle) value for the **revenues** and **profits** columns, we could use the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","medians = f500[[\"revenues\", \"profits\"]].median(axis=0)\n","# we could also use .median(axis=\"index\")\n","print(medians)\n","\n","revenues    40236.0\n","profits      1761.6\n","dtype: float64\n","  \n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","In fact, the default value for the axis parameter with these methods is **axis=0**, so we could have just used the **median()** method without a parameter to get the same result!\n","\n","Another extremely handy method for exploring data in pandas is the [Series.value_counts()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) method. The **Series.value_counts()** method displays each unique non-null value from a series, with a count of the number of times that value is used. We saw above that the **sector** column has 21 unique values. Let's use **Series.value_counts()** to look at the top 5:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(f500[\"sector\"].value_counts().head())\n","\n","    Financials                118\n","    Energy                     80\n","    Technology                 44\n","    Motor Vehicles & Parts     34\n","    Wholesalers                28\n","    Name: sector, dtype: int64\n","```\n","\n","Let's take a moment to walk through what happened in that line of code:\n","\n","- We used the **print()** function to print the output of the following method chain:\n","    - Select the **sector** column from the **f500** dataframe, and on the resulting series\n","    - Use the **Series.value_counts()** to produce a series of the unique values and their counts in order, and on the resulting series\n","    - Use the [Series.head()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.head.html#pandas.Series.head) method to return the first 5 items only.\n","    \n","    \n","We haven't seen the **Series.head()** method before, but it works similarly to **DataFrame.head()**, returning the first five items from a series, or a different number if you provide an argument.\n","\n","The **Series.value_counts()** method is one of the handiest methods to use when exploring a data set. It's also one of the few series methods that doesn't have a dataframe counterpart.\n","\n","Don't worry too much about having to remember which methods belong to which objects for now.
